"""
Functional tests for {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}.

In general, functional tests

- test the end-to-end behavior of a system, ideally from the end-user's perspective
- treat the system as a black box, i.e. do not depend on the internal implementation of the system
  so that the tests do not break when the internal implementation changes.
  "Test to the interface, not the implementation."

This folder ideally has a parallel folder structure with the src/{{cookiecutter.package_import_name}}/ folder,
though it may make sense not to test every file, since that may be entering into 
territory that is better covered by unit tests.
